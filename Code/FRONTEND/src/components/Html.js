            <p className=" my-5">The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to
             be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets
              (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScrip.Html elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, 
              images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. 
              HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for
               text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are
                delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as  and  directly 
                introduce content into the page. Other tags such as surround and provide information about 
                    document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display 
                  the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
